					<h3>Exploring the Dashboard</h3><br>
					<p>When you first log into Synopsys eLearning, you are directed to the Dashboard area. The Dashboard summarizes your progress and achievements as you take our courses.</p><br>

					<img src="images/help_dashboard.png" /><br><br>

					<p>Most likely, the courses you will take will be assigned to you from a manager or supervisor within your company. Therefore, the courses made available to you will most likely reflect the kind of training your company feels is best for your professional development.</p><br>

				  </div>

					<div id="1b">

					<p><b>Header:</b></p>

					<img src="images/help_header.png" /><br><br>

					<p>At the top of the Dashboard is the Header, which contains several controls.</p><br><br>

			 	  </div>

				  <div id="1c">

					<p><b>Dashboard Button:</b></p>

					<img src="images/help_dashboard_button.png" /><br><br>

				  <p>Clicking this button navigates you to the Dashboard from any point in the eLearning platform.</p><br><br>

				<div id="1e">

				<p><b>Notifications:</b></p>

				<img src="images/help_notifications.png"/><br><br>

				<p>Clicking this button directs you to the Notifications panel, where you can find system messages and notices from your managers. A count of new notifications will show here at the start of each session.</p><br><br>

			  </div>

				<div id="1f">

				<p><b>Profile Avatar:</b></p>

				<img src="images/help_profile_avatar.png"/><br><br>

				<p>Your profile avatar produces a dropdown containing options for managing your account profile, changing settings, viewing discussions, and logging out.</p><br><br>

				</div>

				<div id="1g">

				<p><b>Summary:</b></p>
				<p>Near the top of the Dashboard is the Summary area.</p>

				<img src="images/help_summary.png"/><br><br>

				<p>The Summary area displays the most critical metrics produced from your progress through our courses. These include:</p><br>

				<p><b>Number of Assigned Courses in Curriculum:</b> Your curriculum reflects the total number of courses assigned to you through one or more cohorts. A cohort is defined as a group of learners sharing the same course assignments determined by their manager.</p><br>

				<p><b>Amount of Curriculum Completed:</b> This value, stated as a percentage, reflects how many assigned courses you have completed against the total number of courses within your curriculum.</p><br>

				<p><b>Number of Assessments Passed:</b> This metric reflects how many of your completed knowledge assessments resulted in a passing score. A knowledge assessment is a multiple-choice quiz that measures a learner's understanding of the course material. Usually, a learner takes the knowledge assessment after all lessons in any particular course have been marked as completed. In almost all cases, a course is considered completed only when all lessons are completed and the learner earns a passing score on its associated knowledge assessment.</p><br>

				</div>

				<div id="1h">

				<p><b>Curriculum:</b></p>
				<p>Under the Summary area is the Curriculum area.</p>

				<img src="images/help_curriculum.png"/><br><br>

				<p>The Curriculum section displays those courses that have been assigned to you by your manager or supervisor. There are several options to view and organize those courses:</p><br>

				</div>

				<div id="1i">

				<p><b>Keyword Search:</b></p>

				<img src="images/help_search.png"/><br><br>

				<p>Enter a keyword into the search field to view only courses assigned to you that are associated with that keyword.</p><br><br>

				</div>

				<div id="1j">

				<p><b>Course Filters:</b></p>

				<p>The Curriculum section also provides several filter options to help you look for specific courses. Courses may be filtered by the following criteria:</p><br><br>

				<img src="images/help_filters.png"/><br><br>

				<p>Only one criteria may be selected at one time. Selecting an option in one dropdown may affect the available choices in others. The Reset All option returns the dropdown filters to their default selections. The filter criteria are described in more detail below.</p><br><br>

				</div>

				<div id="1k">

				<p><b>Filter By Status:</b></p>

				<img src="images/help_status_drop.png"/><img src="images/help_status_open.png"/><br><br>

				<p>The <b>Filter By Status</b> dropdown allows you to filter the displayed courses based on their state of progress:</p><br>

				<p><b>All Status:</b> Shows all courses assigned to you, regardless of status.</p><br>

				<p><b>Courses in progress:</b> Displays courses that you have started but have not completed (by viewing all lessons and passing the course's knowledge assessment).</p><br>

				<p><b>Courses completed:</b> Displays courses you have completed (that is, have viewed or engaged with all lessons and have passed the final knowledge assessment).</p><br>

				</div>

				<div id="1l">

				<p><b>Filter By Cohorts:</b></p>

				<img src="images/help_cohorts_drop.png"/><img src="images/help_cohorts_open.png"/><br><br>

				<p>The <b>Filter by Cohort</b> dropdown filter will be populated with the names of all cohorts you are assigned to, and by extension, the courses assigned to those cohorts.</p><br>

				<p><b>Filter By Categories:</b></p>

				<img src="images/help_category_drop.png"/><img src="images/help_dd_cat_open.png"/><br><br>

				<p>The <b>Filter by Category</b> dropdown allows you to filter displayed courses based on the categories to which they are assigned. </p><br>

				</div>

				<div id="1n">

				<p><b>Course Tiles:</b></p>

				<p>Beneath the Course Filters can be found the courses themselves. Each course assigned to you is represented by a rectangular tile. You can hover your cursor over these tiles to view a brief course description. Course tiles display the course name, its difficulty level, and the amount of time it should take you to complete the course.</p>

				<p>The course status is indicated at the bottom of each tile, as described below.</p>

				<p><b>Course Not Started:</b></p>

				<img src="images/help_tile_not_started.png"/><br><br>

				<p>Progress is <b>In Progress,</b> courses is indicated in two ways. If you have begun the course but not yet finished the lessons, a partly filled progress bar is displayed at the bottom of the course tile. If you have finished the lessons but not yet taken or successfully passed the knowledge assessment, the tile will display the resulting score from the last attempt, along with the number of attempts you've made.</p><br>

				<p>The Continue button will be displayed until you have successfully completed all lessons and passed the knowledge assessment for the course.</p><br>

				</div>

				<div id="1q">

				<p><b>Course Completed:</b></p>

				<img src="images/help_tile_completed.png"/><br><br>

				<p>Once you have completed a course, your final assessment score will be displayed at the bottom of the course tile, along with the number of attempts. The Review action button is displayed; clicking it allows you to review any lesson in the course and even re-take the knowledge assessment (although your additional score will not be recorded).</p><br><br>

If you reach the bottom of the lesson's webpage and the progress bar does not appear to be full, you have not fully engaged with a particular content section (for example, you may not have watched a video to the end). In such cases, the system will not allow you to click <b>Continue</b> to navigate to the next lesson. The player will inform you of the sections you need to complete (more on this below).</p><br>

If you answer a knowledge check question incorrectly, you must reset the form and try again. When the knowledge check is answered correctly and all content sections are completed, you may then move on to the next lesson. You can take the knowledge check as many times as you want until you arrive at the correct answer. <b>Note: Knowledge checks should not be confused with knowledge assessments.
